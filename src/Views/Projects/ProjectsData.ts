Palvox is an app which allows users (or "Pals") to create short audio recordings on their phones and send them out where the messages will be delivered to a random set of other users. When a message is delivered to your mailbox from another Pal, you will have the option to follow them to continue receiving their future messages. All Pals are anonymous first, meaning that the Pal display names shown in the mailbox are randomly generated and not chosen by users. I wanted this app to be a fun way to connect with strangers in a pro-parasocial format, allowing users to listen to others, not being able to directly communicate back to them but able to toss their own thoughts out to other strangers. Unfortunately, as these projects often go, I got very busy with work and shelved the project only to return and find that I have gotten so much better at systems design that this code base needs a total overhaul. Additionally, capturing audio has less browser support than I originally thought and I would rewrite this project using React Native should I pick it up again.`,
