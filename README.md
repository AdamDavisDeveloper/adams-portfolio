## I love this website!
It's so increibly easy for me to made edits and add new projects due to the way I set up React to generate the website by reading Typescript objects.
```
{
    id: "",
    title: "",
    subtitle: "",
    writeUp: "",
    liveURL: "",
    github: "",
    sections: [
        {
            text: "",
            imgPath: "",
            vertical: false
        },
    ],
    technologies: []
}
```
Above we have an example of a Project's data and my React components handle arrays of such objects to create the website. 👍
